# Static Binaries
This repo is a collection of statically compiled common Linux/Unix tools, which are used for core system functionality, networking and testing/debugging in a modern Linux distribution. These static binaries can also be used in Security Testing/Pentesting engagements. By the time I add support for most popular System Architectures, this'll be the largest such collection of static binaries publicly available.
