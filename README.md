# Static Binaries
This repo is a collection of statically compiled common Linux/Unix tools, which are used for core system functionality, networking and testing/debugging in a modern Linux distribution. These static binaries can also be used in Security Testing/Pentesting engagements. By the time I add support for most popular System Architectures, this'll be the largest such collection of static binaries publicly available.



**DISCLAIMER:-** Except for coreutils everything in this repo is compiled manually by me in order to ensure binaries are compiled from a proper trusted source. I also audited the coreutils automated build script for any urls pointing to malicious sources and found none.
