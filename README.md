# Static Binaries
This repo is a collection of statically compiled common Linux/Unix tools, which are used for core system functionality, networking and testing/debugging in a modern Linux distribution. These static binaries can also be used in Security Testing/Pentesting engagements. By the time I add support for most popular System Architectures, this'll be the largest such collection of static binaries publicly available.


Presently binaries for mips, x86, arm, powerpc and s390x are available. In the future, if I find time I'll try to add support for architectures like risc-v, microblaze, darwin(Mach-O) etc. and more...


**DISCLAIMER:-** Except for coreutils everything in this repo is compiled manually by me in order to ensure binaries are compiled from a proper trusted source. I also audited the coreutils automated build script for any urls pointing to malicious sources and found none.
